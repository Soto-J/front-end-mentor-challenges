### What I learned

[Solution](https://github.com/Soto-J/qr-code-card),
[Live Url](https://soto-j.github.io/qr-code-card/),

by adding meaningful landmarks like <main>, <aside>, and <footer>.
I was having difficulties maintaining the content in the flexbox until I
I added flex-shrink: 0;
I also wasn't sure if i should adjust the image size directly or have it resized automatically in the flexbox.

### Continued development

I will continue to focus on naming conventions, lankmark implemenation, and comments. I will also focus on making sure it's responsive accross all devices.
