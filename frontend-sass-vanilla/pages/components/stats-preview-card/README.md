## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   CSS Grid

### What I learned

-   Had difficulties keeping the content and the image size the same in flexbox.
-   Centering the card using flex box wasnt working the way
    i thought so i centered it by using position absolute
-   Had an issue with setting background image color.

### Continued development

-   I plan on returning to this challenge when i have a better
    understanding of how images behave in flexbox.

-   Remaster challenge
    -   Had difficulties resizing image.
